# Aim-Algorithm-simulators
Python scripts for aiming simulations. 

## Goals
To succesfully shoot a disk to the goal, the disk should be shot in the right direction with the right speed. Here is a list of goals the algorithms are intended to achieve

- Find a trajectory to hit the goal.
- Optimize the trajectory as much as possible so that the disk hits the goal when it is descending.
- Low execution time.
